# Game of Life Melody Generator
Created for Musimathics course of Computer Science degree course in Universit√† degi Studi di Salerno.

The program is a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life for generating melodies based on C major or minor scale. It uses a grid of cells, where each cell can be in one of two states, alive or dead. Each cell of a column rapresents a C scale note. The cells evolve through generations based on a set of rules. The alive cells produce MIDI notes, allowing you to create musical patterns based on the evolution of the cells.

Users can:
- select major or minor scale;
- select some cells or start from a random combination;
- generate a new generation with selected cells + previous generation cells;
- play displayed notes in a row order;
- play displayed notes in a column order;
- clean all grid.

The program could be improved adding other notes, pitch changing and instrument selection.
